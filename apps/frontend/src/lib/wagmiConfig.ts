/**
 * Local anvil (dev) plus Sepolia (the one real testnet this repo targets --
 * see docs/architecture/testnet-deployment.md) -- connect a browser wallet
 * pointed at either to use this app. Not a general multi-chain config: just
 * these two, matching the two KernelDeploymentConfigs packages/config
 * actually knows about (see deploymentsByChainId).
 *
 * Sepolia's transport uses a specific public RPC (verified reachable) rather
 * than viem's bundled default -- an explicit, known-good endpoint rather
 * than an implicit one.
 *
 * ssr: true is required here, not optional — without it wagmi's hooks
 * report "disconnected, no connectors" on the server (no wallet exists
 * during SSR) but read the real injected wallet state on the client's
 * first render, and those two renders disagreeing is a React hydration
 * mismatch. Any real visitor with a wallet extension installed would hit
 * this, not just an injected test provider.
